# Basic example

This example demonstrates basic usable of the editor. We can edit content and then preview it.

We can see that there are two components we're interested in: `ContentEditor`, which gives us the editor, and `ContentPage`, which we would use to show the page to end users.

The editor is a simple controlled component where we pass in a state (which we can initialise with `createPage`, and an `onChange` callback for updates).

That's all it takes to use the editor! ðŸ‘Œ
